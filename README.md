# Select the current outline Plugin

Use `Select current list outline` command to select a line in the list, and all subsequent lines with deeper identation. This mimics a behavior of onenote when pressing Cmd+A twice.

Can use in conjunction with "Move line up/down" commands to more the outline around, or use Tab/Shift-Tab to change outline level
